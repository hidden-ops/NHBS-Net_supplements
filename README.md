The fold "./video of standardization" contains three folds: raw_avi, vis_avi, and screen_avi. In the raw_avi, the files in it are the raw videos that cropped sensitive patients' information. The vis_avi fold contains videos with the segmentation results by our NHBS-Net. Additionally, the screen_vis fold has videos that pass through the standard image screening model.
